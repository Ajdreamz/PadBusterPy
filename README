PadBusterPy - Automated script for performing Padding Oracle attacks using Python

Author in Python: Ajay Kumar Guttikonda

PadBusterPy is a python script for automating Padding Oracle Attacks. PadBuster  
provides the capability to decrypt arbitrary ciphertext, encrypt arbitrary plaintext, 
and perform automated response analysis to determine whether a request is vulnerable 
to padding oracle attacks.

Why when we have already padbuster.pl ?
This is an improvement to padbuster.pl to make parallel requests and response for quicker TAT using python's concurrent.futures concept.

I am not a python expert but, I have searched the web for understannding and coded as nice as possibe.
I might have re-used some of the code from other projects of python from the web. 
Please let me know if the code used looks inspired from your code; I shall add your name to the credits depending on the proof of inspiration.

Known Issues:
Sometimes Block retry is not working.Its random and full restart it works fine.So, unable to fix the same at this point of time.

Testing:
I have tested with sample cookies decrypt mode and encrypt mode and it looks ok.
Timing is better and improved compared to the native script in perl as the requests are made in parallel.

Drawback:
In native perl padbuster, requests are made upto the success byte and the remaining requests are ignored.
As we are doing parallel requests all 255 request are sent and still timing is a lot better than native padbuster.

Usage:
python3 padbusterpy.py http://example.com:port/profile.php zJXamI7u7sSL60O254KaWrsdVtnkVWo3pTJj1YtE0awo88d%2FwI9UYQ%3D%3D 8 
--cookies iknowmag1k=zJXamI7u7sSL60O254KaWrsdVtnkVWo3pTJj1YtE0awo88d%2FwI9UYQ%3D%3D --verbose True --threads=20

python3 padbusterpy.py http://example.com:port/profile.php zJXamI7u7sSL60O254KaWrsdVtnkVWo3pTJj1YtE0awo88d%2FwI9UYQ%3D%3D 8 --cookies "iknowmag1k=zJXamI7u7sSL60O254KaWrsdVtnkVWo3pTJj1YtE0awo88d%2FwI9UYQ%3D%3D" --plaintext "{\"user\":\"test\",\"role\":\"admin\"}" --threads=20

Help:
python3 padbusterpy.py -h
